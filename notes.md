### Gantry system

* The gantry system cannot load programs anymore after using it and break the connection
* To use properly the gantry system, you have to connect to it with the python program first (first here, first served), and after that start igusRobotControl (to see logs)
* To avoid looping programs, you have to change the execution mode to "single" in the Igus Software
